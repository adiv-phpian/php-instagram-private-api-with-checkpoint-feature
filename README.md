<b> This is a liam cottle library with instagram private api checkpoint issue solved. </b>

<b> Clone repo and run example folder on your browser. you can see how it's works. </b>

<b>Do not use this checkpoint feature for bulk like. There's a chance that you will get checkpoint again or you might need to verify profile once you reach limit.</b>

I created this solution for my own project. I post here for others to use it. Code is not clear and not meet code standard, so i didn't commit the changes to original library.

`Happy coding!`
